# Welcome to the documentation of Geübt-Chewie

This is the allele calling and cgMLST clustering module of NRW-GEÜBT.

User uploaded assemblies are processed in the following steps:

- Allele calling with CHEWBBACCA, using the ChewieSnake pipeline.
- Clustering in two different levels: main clusters and subclusters.
- Merging of the clusters with pre-exisiting cluster nomenclature.
